# 04_ML_GoldMining_ToMaximizeAGoldRecoveryFromOre
To prepare a machine learning prototype model for predicting a coefficient of recovery of gold from the ore in order to find a solution to overcome the challenges of declining ore grades, remove parameters, which do not help increase the gold recovery, and to keep gold mining economically viable.
