## üèÜ **Gold Mining: Maximizing Gold Recovery from Ore**

### **Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning prototype model to predict the coefficient of gold recovery from ore. The goal is to find solutions to the challenges posed by declining ore grades, identify and remove parameters that do not contribute to increasing gold recovery, and ensure that gold mining remains economically viable.

### **Research Question**
How can we maximize output from a gold reserve?

### **Project Description**
This project involves creating a machine learning model that can accurately predict the coefficient of gold recovery. The model will help overcome the challenges associated with declining ore grades by identifying key parameters that influence gold recovery. This will enable more efficient and economically viable gold mining operations.

### **Data**
The data provided includes various parameters related to gold mining and ore processing. The datasets are divided into three categories:
- **All Data**: Comprehensive dataset covering all stages of the process.
- **Rougher Data**: Data specific to the rougher stage of ore processing.
- **Final Data**: Data from the final stage of processing.

The full dataset can be accessed [here](https://github.com/ybezginova2016/04_ML_GoldMining_ToMaximizeAGoldRecoveryFromOre/blob/main/gold_recovery_full_new.csv), and the test dataset is available [here](https://github.com/ybezginova2016/04_ML_GoldMining_ToMaximizeAGoldRecoveryFromOre/blob/main/gold_recovery_test_new.csv).
