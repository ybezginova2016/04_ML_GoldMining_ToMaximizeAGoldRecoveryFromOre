# 04_ML_GoldMining_ToMaximizeAGoldRecoveryFromOre
To prepare a machine learning prototype model for predicting a coefficient of recovery of gold from the ore in order to find a solution to overcome the challenges of declining ore grades, remove parameters, which do not help increase the gold recovery, and to keep gold mining economically viable.

### Project Methodology
- 3 separate datasets given - all, rougher, final;
- sMAPE is used as a quality metrics;
- cross validation is used for choosing the best model.
